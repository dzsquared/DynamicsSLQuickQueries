# DynamicsSLQuickQueries
Collection of useful Dynamics SL Quick Queries

## Ground Rules:
1. Queries should include no *UPDATE*, *DELETE*, or *INSERT* statements.
2. Make your code portable - no specific database names when avoidable.
3. If the quick query relies on SL add-ons, please specify.
4. include a human-readable description of what the QQ shows
5. We aren't going to solve commas at the beginning of a line vs the end of a line, just be consistent in each query.
6. If you chose to display output from a query, don't share confidential information.

## Background
This repository was founded in 2017 for the 10 year anniversary DSLUG conference as a place for the community to share the quick queries that they find most helpful.
GitHub was selected as a hosting ground because it makes the queries easily accessible via the web as well as facilitates code review and source control at a community level.
