With the conference approaching quickly, you're hopefully heading over to the online conference schedule and picking out your sessions.

As a moderator for the Custom Quick Query roundtable, I sincerely hope that you're considering attending my session. (8am on Wednesday morning!)  However, I know that there are many other quality sessions and only so many hours in the day.

**Custom quick queries shared during this session will be available to all conference attendees.**  

To aid in this effort, if you have a customized quick query that you are willing to share, please send me a message and we will enter your quick query into the collection.  You can be someone in IT who can share code or someone in finance who can describe the columns that were added and the use case.  Anyone, in any role, can contribute.

**To sweeten the deal, I'm arranging for minor rewards for the first 10 individuals who share their customized quick queries.**
